# CSCE-315-5TacToe

This is a simple Android application that allows the user to play against two types of AI, written by 
Roger Villanueva (Me), Gustavo Lopez, and Grayson Eiland.

The first AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make the next move based on the player's previous move. The Minimax algorithm 
is described here: http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax. This algorithm was written by Gustavo Lopez.

The second AI uses A* search to make the next move based on the player's previous move. The A* algorithm is described here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm. This algorithm was written by Grayson Eiland.

I wrote all of the Android code and I interfaced C++ to Java using the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the Native Development Kit (NDK).

This project was completed long before the deadline as our group was very clear and specific with each other about how each of our tasks would connect.
